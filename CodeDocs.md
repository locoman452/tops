# Code Documentation #

The operations software makes extensive use of documentation strings that can be automatically extracted. Currently, this is done with the Doxygen tool, although other tools that might be more suitable for python are being considered.

Google code does not provide an easy way to host automatically generated documentation. Instead, documentation can be [browsed here](http://positron.ps.uci.edu/~dkirkby/tops/classes.html).

A compressed tar file of the documentation is also available from the [downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/tops/downloads/list).
